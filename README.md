My GitHub account was made over 2 years ago and I only have 2 repositories
I created this repository for my CTI-110 class
I created the repository on the GitHub website, cloned it on the GitHub Desktop, fetched the origin, edited the README, summarized and pushed my changes to main by clicking on the "Push origin" button
